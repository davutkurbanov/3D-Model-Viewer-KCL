# 🏛️ Museum 3D Object Explorer
Master’s Assignment — Interactive 3D Viewer for Museums
Overview

The Museum 3D Object Explorer is a React-based prototype that explores how interactive 3D objects and lightweight game mechanics can enhance digital museum experiences.

Designed as part of a master’s-level academic assignment, the project reimagines how museum collections—such as those held by the British Museum—can be experienced online beyond static images and text.

Users can either explore artifacts freely or engage in a playful guessing mode that encourages curiosity about cultural origins and historical context.

### Core Concept

Traditional museum websites often present objects passively. This project investigates how:

3D interaction

Minimal gamification

Contextual storytelling

can increase engagement, learning, and memorability in digital heritage spaces.

## Key Features
### 🧱 Interactive 3D Object Viewer

Real-time rendering of STL-based 3D models

Users can rotate, zoom, and inspect artifacts freely

Designed to mimic close, object-focused museum viewing

### 🌍 Cultural Context & Storytelling

Each object includes:

Historical descriptions

Country of origin

External reference links (e.g. Wikipedia)

Encourages contextual rather than purely visual engagement

### 🎮 “Guess the Country” Play Mode

A lightweight educational game mode

Users guess the country of origin of an object

Limited guesses introduce challenge without pressure

Object descriptions unlock after correct guesses or attempts are exhausted

This mode explores learning-through-play rather than explicit instruction.

### 🧭 Explore Mode

Browse objects freely without constraints

Navigate between artifacts using gallery-style controls

View related objects to encourage comparative exploration

### 🛍️ Museum Commerce Concept (Speculative)

Prototype “Buy” flow for 3D-printed replicas

Size selection (small / medium / large)

Conceptual bridge between:

Digital collections

Museum gift shops

On-demand fabrication
